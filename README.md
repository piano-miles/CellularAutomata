# CellularAutomata

Cellular Automata in Processing

This is a cellular automata simulator, created for MacOSX. Java and Processing files are included.

- First, choose one of the three rules
- You can click to toggle cells. If you drag, all cells over the mouse will be set to the same cell ID, just like in Golly
- The space key will toggle starting/stopping generation incrementation
- The 's' key will increment by a single generation
- The 'c' key will clear the world
- The 'r' key will will the world with a random soup
- The 'enter' key will return the world back to generation 0, with what it was at generation 0, just like in Golly
- 'Command Q' will exit the program
- Exit and relaunch the program to switch to a different rule

And that is it! Have fun!
